## About Me

Hi! I'm Zanatta Gregory, a 3rd-year game development student at Objectif3D.  
I specialize in gameplay programming, multiplayer systems, and production tool development.  
I mainly work with C++, C#, Unreal Engine, and Unity, with a strong focus on gameplay architecture and workflow efficiency.

## Other information
👩‍💻 I'm currently working on  
A long-term academic game project as part of my 3rd year at Objectif3D, focused on advanced Unreal Engine workflows and integrated production tools.

👯‍♂️ I'm open to collaborate on  
Any interesting game dev or tool development project with clear goals and solid motivation behind it.

🤔 I'm looking for help with  
Advanced Unreal tooling, editor scripting, and production pipeline optimization.
